## Scripts included
There is only one script relevant, run_analysis.R. This script runs all the steps asked for in the assignment, albeit not in the same order. This is done at prurpose. For more info see the CodeBook.md document

## Reading the mergedAveragedTidyData.txt file
The .txt is prepared in such a way that it can be read in with a simple read.table statement:
read.table("mergedAveragedTidyData.txt", header=TRUE)
